  <h3 class="paragraphHeader">We’re Scholarly</h3>
  <p>Our faculty are more than professors; they’re scholars, mentors, and friends. Ninety percent hold a PhD or the highest degree in their field. With small classes – the average class is 13 students and 80% are fewer than 20 students – you’ll find an extremely supportive community ready to help you succeed. VWU offers 33 majors, 30 minors, and seven pre-professional programs.  Undergraduate research is an integral part of the VWU experience. You don’t have to wait until graduate school to pursue in-depth study of a subject near to your heart.</p>

  <h3 class="paragraphHeader">We’re Nationally Recognized and Our Graduates are in Demand</h3>
  <p>Virginia Wesleyan has been selected for inclusion in The Princeton Review’s Best 381 Colleges: 2017 Edition and as a 2016-2017 College of Distinction for excellence in student-focused education. Understandably, given the University’s academic reputation, 92 percent of VWU graduates are employed or in graduate school within a year of leaving campus.</p>

  <h3 class="paragraphHeader">We’re Competitive </h3>
  <p>Virginia Wesleyan is a proud member of the Old Dominion Conference (ODAC), and fields 22 men’s and women’s teams.  Our Division III student-athletes study hard, train hard, and win! With nationally ranked teams, All-American athletes, and truly committed and caring coaches, VWU athletes get the best of both worlds – academic and athletic success.</p>

  <h3 class="paragraphHeader">We’re Campus Focused</h3>
  <p>Our beautiful 283-acre campus is a park-like oasis. Full-time undergraduate students between the ages of 17 – 23 are required to live on campus, unless residing at home with their parents. Students choose between four residential villages, and housing options include traditional two-person residence hall rooms, suites, and townhouses. When not in class student can participate in 50+ clubs and organizations, when not simply hanging out in the Jane P. Batten Student Center, which features a 36-foot rock-climbing wall, fitness center, three racquetball courts, 8-lane swimming pool, multi-purpose practice gymnasium, and both a dining center and grille.</p>

  <h3 class="paragraphHeader">We’re Affordable</h3>
